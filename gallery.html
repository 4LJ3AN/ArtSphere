    <h2>Starry Night</h2>
    <p><strong>Artist:</strong> Vincent van Gogh</p>
    <p><strong>Technique:</strong> Oil Painting</p>
    <p><strong>Style:</strong> Post-Impressionism</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
    <p>Vincent van Gogh’s The Starry Night is one of the most iconic and emotionally powerful paintings in art history. Created in June 1889 during Van Gogh's stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France, it captures a swirling night sky filled with energy, emotion, and movement, seen from the window of his room.</p>
    <p><strong>Historical Context:</strong></p>
    <p>Van Gogh painted The Starry Night while voluntarily confined in an asylum after a series of mental breakdowns, including the famous incident in which he cut off part of his own ear. Despite the dark circumstances, the painting radiates awe and wonder.
        Interestingly, Van Gogh did not consider The Starry Night one of his best works. He felt it was overly stylized and even called it a failure in his letters. However, it later became one of his most celebrated masterpieces and a defining image of modern art.</p>

    <h2>Mona Lisa</h2>
    <p><strong>Artist:</strong> Leonardo da Vinci</p>
    <p><strong>Technique:</strong> Oil Painting</p>
    <p><strong>Style:</strong> Renaissance</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
    <p>Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa is arguably the most famous and recognized painting in the world. Created between 1503 and 1506 (possibly continuing until 1517), this iconic portrait has fascinated viewers for centuries due to its subject’s mysterious expression, innovative technique, and subtle detail.</p>
    <p><strong>Historical Context</strong></p>
    <p>Leonardo likely carried the painting with him for years, including during his final stay in France under the patronage of King Francis I. After Leonardo's death in 1519, the painting entered the French royal collection and eventually found its way to the Louvre Museum in Paris, where it remains today.

      In 1911, the painting was famously stolen by an Italian handyman who believed it should be returned to Italy. It was recovered two years later and became even more famous because of the incident. Since then, it's survived attacks, protests, and the test of time.</p>

    <h2>The Persistence of Memory</h2>
    <p><strong>Artist:</strong> Salvador Dalí</p>
    <p><strong>Technique:</strong> Oil Painting</p>
    <p><strong>Style:</strong> Surrealism</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
    <p> Salvador Dalí’s The Persistence of Memory (1931) is one of the most iconic and recognizable works of Surrealist art. Often referred to as the “melting clocks painting,” it presents a dreamlike world where time appears to have lost all meaning—challenging the viewer’s perception of reality, time, and memory.</p>
    <p><strong>Historical Context</strong></p>
    <p>Dalí painted The Persistence of Memory at the age of 27, during a particularly prolific period. He was deeply influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud and the workings of the unconscious mind. Dalí’s dreamlike world, filled with symbolic objects, became his signature style.

      He described his works as “hand-painted dream photographs,” aiming to create realistic images of fantastical, irrational ideas.</p>

    <h2>The Girl with a Pearl Earring</h2>
    <p><strong>Artist:</strong>Johannes Vermeer</p>
    <p><strong>Technique:</strong>Realism</p>
    <p><strong>Style:</strong> Baroque / Dutch Golden Age</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
    <p>Johannes Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring (circa 1665) is one of the most beloved and mysterious portraits in Western art. Often called the “Mona Lisa of the North,” this painting captivates viewers with its simplicity, intimacy, and the enigmatic expression of the girl.</p>
    <p><strong>Historical Context</strong></p>
    <p>Little is known about the identity of the girl. Some theories suggest she may have been Vermeer’s daughter or a maid, but most scholars agree she was likely a model created for artistic study rather than a portrait of a known individual.

      Johannes Vermeer, though not widely known during his lifetime, is now celebrated for his ability to capture quiet, contemplative moments. He created fewer than 40 paintings in total, which adds to the rarity and value of his work.</p>

    <h2>The Scream</h2>
    <p><strong>Artist:</strong>Edvard Munch</p>
    <p><strong>Technique:</strong>Tempera and pastel</p>
    <p><strong>Style:</strong>Expressionism</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
    <p>Edvard Munch’s The Scream (first version created in 1893) is one of the most powerful visual expressions of human anxiety, despair, and existential fear ever put to canvas. It has become an icon of modern art—instantly recognizable and endlessly interpreted.    </p>
    <p><strong>Versions & Medium:</strong></p>
    <p>There are <strong>main versions of The Scream</strong> created between 1893 and 1910:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>1893 (tempera on cardboard)</strong>– The most famous version, located in the National Gallery, Oslo.</li>
    <li><strong>1893 (pastel on cardboard) </strong>– Owned by the Munch Museum, Oslo.</li> 
    <li><strong>1895 (pastel)</strong>– Privately owned (sold at auction for nearly $120 million in 2012).</li>  
    <li><strong>1910 (painted version) </strong>– Also held at the Munch Museum.</li> 
    <p> Munch also created lithographs, allowing the image to be reproduced and distributed more widely.</p>

    <h2>Creation of Adam  </h2>
    <p><strong>Artist:</strong> Michaelangelo</p>
    <p><strong>Technique:</strong> Fresco</p>
    <p><strong>Style:</strong> High Renaissance</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
    <p>Michelangelo’s The Creation of Adam (circa 1511–1512) is one of the most famous and celebrated frescoes in the history of art. Located on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City, this iconic scene has become a symbol of humanity, divine spark, and the relationship between man and God.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Historical Context:</strong></p>
    <p>Michelangelo painted the Creation of Adam as part of the larger Sistine Chapel ceiling, commissioned by Pope Julius II. The ceiling contains more than 300 figures and nine central scenes from the Book of Genesis, including The Creation of the Sun and Moon, The Fall of Man, and The Great Flood.
      Although initially reluctant to take the commission (Michelangelo considered himself a sculptor), he completed the monumental ceiling between 1508 and 1512, working mostly alone while standing or lying on scaffolding.</p>

    <h2>The Last Supper</h2>
    <p><strong>Artist: Leonardo Da Vinci</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Technique:</strong> Wall Painting</p>
    <p><strong>Style:</strong> High Renaissance</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
    <p>Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper (painted between 1495 and 1498) is one of the most revered and influential masterpieces of the Renaissance. This iconic mural captures the dramatic and emotional moment Jesus announces that one of the twelve apostles will betray him. It's not just a religious image—it’s a groundbreaking study of human emotion, storytelling through art, and mastery of perspective.</p>
    <p><strong>Historical Context:</strong></p>
    <p>Leonardo painted The Last Supper during a time of flourishing art, science, and religious influence in Renaissance Italy. Commissioned by Duke Ludovico Sforza, it decorated the wall of the monastery’s refectory (dining hall), where monks would eat while contemplating this sacred scene.

      It’s a visual meditation on betrayal, sacrifice, and faith, capturing the pivotal moment in the New Testament (John 13:21).

    <h2>Spoliarium</h2>
    <p><strong>Artist:</strong> Juan Luna</p>
    <p><strong>Technique:</strong> Oil Painting</p>
    <p><strong>Style:</strong> Romanticism / Realism</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
    <p>Juan Luna’s Spoliarium (1884) is one of the most iconic and historically significant paintings in Philippine art. Measuring a massive 4.22 meters tall and 7.675 meters wide, this epic oil on canvas is a powerful allegory of colonial oppression, human suffering, and the struggle for freedom and dignity.</p>
    <p><strong>Historical Context:</strong></p>
    <p>Juan Luna painted the Spoliarium while he was studying in Madrid. It was his entry to the prestigious Exposición Nacional de Bellas Artes in 1884, where it won the first gold medal—a monumental achievement for a Filipino under Spanish rule.

      The painting became a symbol of Filipino pride and awakening, especially among the members of the Propaganda Movement, which sought reform and recognition for Filipinos.
      
      José Rizal, Luna’s close friend and the Philippines’ national hero, described the Spoliarium as:
      
      “the essence of our social, moral, and political life: humanity unredeemed, reason and idealism trampled by force, and the blood of the innocent flowing.”
      
      It stirred a generation of intellectuals and revolutionaries, fueling a growing sense of Filipino identity and resistance.

    <h2>American Gothic</h2>
    <p><strong>Artist:</strong> Grant Wood</p>
    <p><strong>Technique:</strong> Oil Paintig</p>
    <p><strong>Style:</strong> Baroque</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
    <p>Grant Wood’s American Gothic (1930) is one of the most recognizable and parodied paintings in American art. With its hauntingly still atmosphere and deeply symbolic imagery, it captures a slice of rural American life during the Great Depression—and invites viewers to question what's beneath its solemn surface.</p>
    <p><strong>Inpiration & Creation:</strong></p>
    <p>Grant Wood, an Iowa-born artist, was inspired when he saw a small white cottage in Eldon, Iowa, with a Gothic-style window. He imagined who might live there and asked his sister Nan Wood Graham and his dentist Dr. Byron McKeeby to pose as a father and daughter (not husband and wife, as commonly assumed).

      He painted them in traditional, even outdated, 19th-century clothing to evoke old-fashioned values and a timeless rural spirit.</p>

    <h2>The Great Wave off Kanagawa</h2>
    <p><strong>Artist:</strong> Hokusai</p>
    <p><strong>Technique:</strong> OIl Painting</p>
    <p><strong>Style:</strong>Ukiyo-e (Japanese Art)</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
    <p>Katsushika Hokusai’s The Great Wave off Kanagawa (c. 1831) is one of the most famous and celebrated works of Japanese art—and arguably one of the most recognized images in the world. This iconic woodblock print captures the raw power of nature, the smallness of humanity, and the beauty of traditional Japanese art and craftsmanship.

    <p>Gustav Klimt’s The Kiss (1907–1908) is a dazzling, golden masterpiece that captures a moment of deep intimacy, love, and spiritual connection.
