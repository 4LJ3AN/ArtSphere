      <h2>Pencil Shading</h2>
      <p>Shading is adding dark and light areas to a drawing to create the look of form, space, and light. For example, when drawing an apple, you would use shading to make one side darker than the other, giving the apple a rounded, three-dimensional appearance.</p>
      <p>Let’s begin exploring shading techniques.</p>
      
      <h3>Blending</h3>
      <img src="https://www.21-draw.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/a-portrait-of-a-girl-shaded-using-blending-shading-technique-1024x683.jpg" alt="Charcoal Drawing Example" class="modal-img">
      <p>Blending is probably the most commonly used pencil shading technique. This technique focuses more on concealing the application of marks instead of making specific marks. It can be done with any medium but often works best with pencil and charcoal drawings.</p>
      <p>The goal of blending is to create a smooth gradation from one tone to another rather than a sharp transition. This can be achieved by applying the media seamlessly or rubbing it with a finger or smudging tool.</p>     
      <p>When blending, it’s important to build up the tone gradually and use a light touch. Blending too aggressively can result in a muddy or blurry effect.</p>

      <h3>Hatching</h3>
      <img src="https://www.21-draw.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sketch-of-squirrel-shaded-using-parallel-hatching-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Charcoal Drawing Example" class="modal-img">
      <p>Hatching is done by drawing a series of closely spaced parallel lines. These lines can be drawn at any angle. However, the direction should be uniform throughout the area being shaded.</p>
      <p>The closer together the lines are, the darker the shading will be. Varying the line width and spacing can create different effects.

        Hatching can also be used to create the illusion of texture, like the fur of an animal.</p>     
      <p>Hatching can be used alone or in combination with other shading techniques, such as cross-hatching and stippling.</p>

      <h3>Cross-Hatching</h3>
      <img src="https://www.21-draw.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hand-shaded-using-cross-hatching-shading-technique-1024x683.jpg" alt="Charcoal Drawing Example" class="modal-img">
      <p>Cross-hatching is a shading technique that uses two sets of parallel lines crossed at an angle. This creates a mesh-like effect that can create different shading effects.</p>
      <p>Cross-hatching is done by drawing one set of parallel lines in one direction and then drawing another set of parallel lines over the first set in a perpendicular direction.</p>     
      <p>The closer-spaced lines will create a darker shading, while further-spaced lines will create a lighter shading. By playing with the spacing and angle of the lines, you can create shading that ranges from subtle to dramatic.</p>
      <p>Cross-hatching can be done alone or with other shading techniques to create even more complex and interesting effects.</p>

      <h3>Contour Hatching</h3>
      <img src="https://www.21-draw.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rabbbit-shaded-using-contour-hatching-shading-technique-1024x683.jpg" alt="Charcoal Drawing Example" class="modal-img">
      <p>This technique is slightly similar to hatching. However, instead of parallel lines, contour hatching uses curved lines that follow the object’s shaded contours (or outlines). This creates a more natural look and can create different effects depending on the line width, spacing, and direction.</p>
      <p>To contour hatch, draw a contour line of the object you want to shade. Then, draw a series of curved contour lines within that contour, following its shape.</p>     
      <p>This technique can also be combined with hatching and cross-hatching to create more complex effects.</p>

      <h3>Woven Hatching</h3>
      <img src="https://www.21-draw.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sketch-of-a-sqirrel-shaded-using-woven-hatching-1024x683.jpg" alt="Charcoal Drawing Example" class="modal-img">
      <p>Woven hatching is done by drawing a set of parallel lines in one direction. Next, a second set of parallel lines is drawn next to the first set in a perpendicular or nearly perpendicular direction. This creates a woven effect that can create different illusions and shading effects.</p>
      <p>Cross-hatching can be added to woven hatching to add density in darker areas.</p>     
      <p>Woven hatching can create different effects depending on the spacing between the lines and the sets of lines. Experiment with different spacing to see what effects you can create.</p>

      <h3>Stippling</h3>
      <img src="https://www.21-draw.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sketch-of-a-sword-shaded-using-stippling-technique-1024x683.jpg" alt="Charcoal Drawing Example" class="modal-img">
      <p>Stippling is a shading technique that uses small dots to create shadows and highlights. The dots can be any size, but they are usually uniform in size throughout the area being shaded.</p>
      <p>The number of dots used and their placement can be varied to create different effects. The closer together the dots are, the darker the shading will be.</p>     
      <p>Stippling requires patience as it can be time-consuming, but the results can be worth it.</p>

      <h3>Scribbling</h3>
      <img src="https://www.21-draw.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/portrait-of-a-man-shaded-using-scribbling-shading-technique-1024x683.jpg" alt="Charcoal Drawing Example" class="modal-img">
      <p>Scribbling is a shading technique that uses random, unplanned strokes to produce shadows and highlights. It is a quick way to add shading to an image.</p>
      <p>This shading technique also creates a textured look and is often used on artworks depicting trees or hair.</p>     
      <p>You can control the effects by increasing or decreasing the density of the scribbles. The closely packed strokes or scribbles will create a darker shading, while further apart strokes will create a lighter shading.</p>

      <h2>Watercolor Painting</h2>
      <p>Watercolor uses pigments suspended in water for a translucent effect. It’s known for its flowing colors and soft textures.</p>
